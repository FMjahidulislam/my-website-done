            <h2>A good man is greater than a successfull man</h2>
            <p>Hello there! Before talking about qualifications and professional abilities, I would like to introduce myself. I am <b>FM Jahidul Islam</b> and I am from Bangladesh. Taking web development as a profession not only fulfills my pocket but also my heart because it has been my passion since my early teenage.
                I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays. That’s why I chose freelance web development as my career because I believe I’m good at this and mas I am always honest and I am never afraid of doing hard work.
                I am very much an expert in using <b> HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and Note JS</b>. I have developed various websites to optimize their search engines and to create easier user interfaces.</p>
